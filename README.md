## Projects
My biggest projects are on my portfolio:

### [3D Painter](https://dpakb.herokuapp.com/3d_painter)
Create beautiful art on a 3D canvas. Use multiple brush colours, the
world grid and guide grid to create anything you can imagine. This game
runs on desktop as well as mobile and will soon support multiplayer for
people who want to paint together. Uses hardware accelerated graphics
all from the comfort of your web browser.<br/>

Technologies used: WebGL, Javascript, Three.js, Heroku <br/>
[Logic can be found here](https://github.com/dbzguy56/portfolio/blob/3d_painter_setup/app/assets/javascripts/painter.js) <br/>
This is an ongoing project, next steps include multiplayer pictionary through the use of websockets.

Technologies used: Ruby On Rails, eRuby, HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, Heroku <br/>

### [Mastermind](https://dpakb.herokuapp.com/mastermind)
Test your code-cracking skills with Mastermind. Mastermind is a
strategy game that must be won in 12 turns or less. The game creates a
secret colour code. You must find it using the feedback from your
previous guesses. Can you crack the secret colour code? <br/>
Logic can be found across multiple files/directories like the [controllers](https://github.com/dbzguy56/portfolio/tree/master/app/controllers) and [models](https://github.com/dbzguy56/portfolio/tree/master/app/models) folder
