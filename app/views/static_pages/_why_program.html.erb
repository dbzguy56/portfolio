    <h2>Challenges<%= image_tag('thinking') %></h2>
    <p>I love challenges, whether it be programming, basketball, or video games.
    I love a good challenge and can be pretty competitive. </p>
    <h2>Problem solving</h2>
    <p>I also love solving problems. It is satisfying when everything clicks.
    Like trying to solve a hard math problem. Once you learn and figure out
    how to do it, it is satisfying to see something work and also make sense.</p>

    <h2>Virtual sandbox<%= image_tag('parents') %></h2>
    <p>All you need is a computer and you can make anything! Once you learn a language,
       it becomes much easier to learn other languages and make cool things in other fields.</p>
    <h2>My parents</h2>
    <p>My parents have been through tough times, from living in the village in
      India to immigrating to Canada.  They came here to give me and my siblings a chance at a better
      life and education. I am truly grateful and cannot thank them enough, as I have not come close to
      the amount of challenges that they have faced. All for me to be able to learn and do what I am
      passionate about. It is my time to give back.</p>
    <p>I would also like to thank my family, cousins, and friends for their amazing support, as I would
      not have been able to come this far without.</p>
